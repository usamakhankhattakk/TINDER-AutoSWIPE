# Tinder Auto Liker

This is a simple JavaScript script to automate the process of liking profiles on Tinder. Please use this script responsibly and in accordance with Tinder's terms of service.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, make sure you have the following:

- A web browser with access to the Tinder website.
- Basic knowledge of using the browser's developer tools.

## Usage

1. Open Tinder in your web browser.

2. Open the developer console. You can usually do this by right-clicking on the page, selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," and then navigating to the "Console" tab.

3. Copy and paste the entire script into the console and press Enter.

4. You will be prompted to enter the number of likes you want to send. Please enter a number between 1 and 99 that is a multiple of 3. For example, 6 or 12.

5. If you enter an invalid number (e.g., less than 1, more than 99, or not a multiple of 3), you will see an "invalid number" message in the console.

6. If you enter a valid number, you will be prompted to confirm if you want to start swiping right. Click "OK" to start, or "Cancel" to stop.

7. The script will automatically like profiles at a rate of 3 likes every 1 second. You can monitor the progress in the console.

8. To stop the script, close the browser tab or window where Tinder is open, or refresh the page.
